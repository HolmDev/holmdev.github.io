## General

This site is mainly just a place for me to dump short "articles" about things I discover/create while using computer and technology. The themes for the articles are therefore mostly about things such as Linux, Emacs, and WMs.

## About me

Well, who am I? The short answer is: a giant nerd. The slightly longer answer: a guy with way too much free time on his hands. I spend most of that time programming things, ricing my setup or tinkering with technology in general.

Where can you find me:
