However, there are a few things I missed from Windows, especially being able to see the volume level while adjusting it even when using an application fullscreen. The included Qtile widget wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing it for me so I decided to make my own volume display using dunstify.
Important This script is made for a setup using PulseAudio or Pipewire (with pipewire-pulse) as an audio server and that has pamixer installed.</description></item><item><title>Creating an RGB Keyboard Legend</title><link>https://holmdev.github.io/articles/creating-an-rgb-keyboard-legend/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holmdev.github.io/articles/creating-an-rgb-keyboard-legend/</guid><description>I recently found this post, where user u/Rasie1 had created a script for displaying their i3 keybinds when certain modifier keys were pressed. I thought it looked really dope and that it would fit nicely with the rest of my keyboard-centric setup, so I made my own.
I decided to use OpenRGB for controlling my Blackwidow V2&amp;rsquo;s RGB, since it fits my needs very well and has been my main RGB solution since the beginning of my Linux journey.</description></item></channel></rss>
